# -Predictive-Modeling-for-Salary-Based-on-Experience
## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of a dataset that explores the relationship between years of experience and salary. The goal is to build predictive models to estimate salaries based on an 
individual's experience. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and the implementation of various regression models.



## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I started by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics. The EDA provides insights into the distribution of experience and salary.

## Bar Charts: Impact of Experience on Salary

A series of bar charts have been plotted to visually depict the impact of experience on salary, helping to highlight trends or patterns in the dataset.

## Regression Models

I implemented four regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor. Each model is trained on the dataset to predict 
salaries based on experience.

## Performance Metrics

- R^2 Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

These metrics provide a quantitative assessment of each model's performance.

## Identifying the Best Model

The model with the highest R^2 score was identified as the best fit for the data, ensuring accurate predictions.

## Making Predictions

Using the best-performing model, I made predictions on new data to demonstrate the practical application of the trained model.
